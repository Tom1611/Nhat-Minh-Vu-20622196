        "Firstky, I used the 5-step method taught in university from Week 2 - Activity 3 to build my approach before using AI assistance. This method included stating the problem, describing the input/output, and reviewing examples myself before asking the AI ​​to write pseudocode. The \"Plan Before Code\" approach from Week 2 taught me how to use AI to refine rather than give assignments, which will help in my future career path as not all places can use AI support. I was assigned the Manager task while the AI ​​helped formalize the pseudocode structure. This division ensures I understand the logic before implementation, which aligns with the course's focus on human-led planning with AI as a validation tool.\n",

        "I applied the \"Error Handling Thinking\" at Week 11 when debugging a faulty Task Manager. It helped me analyze why each error like tas,list task - caused NameErrors at runtime. This ties in with Week 12 - an introduction to debugging.Furthermore, i am using the defensive programming I learned in Week 3 - Activities when adding input validation to check if it's available for the task description before processing. This proactive check prevented errors instead of asking again for the user validation patterns we practiced with the weather menu selections ở tuần đó.\n",

        "For the asessment 3, I applied the refinement process presented in Part 1 by starting with basic pseudocode and gradually adding validation at Week 3 and error handling at Week 11. Using the doctest format from Week 12 - Activity 1, I learned more about the concept of empty input, invalid range from the beginning instead of going back to the beginning. This approach will detect problems earlier in the development process.\n",
